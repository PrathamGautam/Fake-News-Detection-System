Introduction
In the digital age, the spread of fake news has become a significant concern. This project aims to address this issue by providing a system that can automatically classify news articles as real or fake using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares text data for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Uses techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings.
Model Training: Trains machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and neural networks.
Evaluation: Evaluates the performance of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Prediction: Predicts whether a given news article is real or fake.
Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
Create a virtual environment:

sh
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Preprocess the data:

sh
Copy code
python preprocess.py
Train the model:

sh
Copy code
python train.py
Evaluate the model:

sh
Copy code
python evaluate.py
Make predictions:

sh
Copy code
python predict.py --text "Your news article text here"
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle's Fake News dataset. Ensure you have the dataset downloaded and placed in the data directory before running the project.

Model Training
The model training script (train.py) allows for training different models by specifying parameters in a configuration file or through command-line arguments. Example:

sh
Copy code
python train.py --model logistic_regression
Results
The performance of the models is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Detailed results and comparison of models can be found in the results directory.
