## Introduction

In the digital age, the spread of fake news has become a significant concern. This project aims to address this issue by providing a system that can automatically classify news articles as real or fake using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares text data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings.
- **Model Training**: Trains machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and neural networks.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Prediction**: Predicts whether a given news article is real or fake.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
    cd fake-news-detection
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Preprocess the data**:
    ```sh
    python preprocess.py
    ```

2. **Train the model**:
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```

3. **Evaluate the model**:
    ```sh
    python evaluate.py
    ```

4. **Make predictions**:
    ```sh
    python predict.py --text "Your news article text here"
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Fake News dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data). Ensure you have the dataset downloaded and placed in the `data` directory before running the project.

## Model Training

The model training script (`train.py`) allows for training different models by specifying parameters in a configuration file or through command-line arguments. Example:
```sh
python train.py --model logistic_regression
```

## Results
The performance of the models is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Detailed results and comparison of models can be found in the results directory.
